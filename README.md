# bubble-sort
In this project I will create a bubble sort program, tracking if a sort has occured and exiting early if no sort has occured during a loop, as that means the array is sorted already.

Reflections:
This was my first time using the until loop but it served its purpose flawlessly.  I had one error in this project which was caused by using the inclusive range for i to array length, which caused it to check a value for an index one higher than array had, returning a nil comparison.  The fix was simply to change it to the exclusive range.
